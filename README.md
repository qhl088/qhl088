### Hi there 👋

#  🙋 Hello

<p>✍️&nbsp;&nbsp; Hi, I'm Virgil Qiao, a passionate, self-motivation Software Tester, now I'm working in a project with Ministry of Health NZ, my passion for software lies with dreaming up ideas and making them come true with high quality. I take great care in the experience, architecture, and code quality of the things I build</p>
<p>&emsp;&emsp;We're making the world a better place. Through constructing elegant hierarchies for maximum code reuse and extensibility.</p>
<p>&emsp;&emsp;我们正在让这个世界变得更加美好，通过代码的重复使用和延展构建完美体系。</p>
<p>&emsp;&emsp;我开始得太晚了，但总归不算太迟。春华秋实，努力一定会有收获，一枚学渣正在悄悄蜕变。。。</p>
